It is live at <a href="https://stingclaw.github.io/century-theme/">stingclaw.github.io/century-theme</a>. It is integrated with FontAwesome, a useful icon font (<a href="http://fontawesome.io">fontawesome.io</a>). It also features social media icons which you can customize. However, there may be some issues with the CSS if you're hosting it on GitHub Pages, which is a strange problem.</div></div>

I would use a @media query, such as the following:</p><pre>@media screen and (min-width: 700px) {
  #inner {
    width: 700px;
    margin: auto;
  }
}</pre><p>This method takes up 6 lines of code, and complexifies the whole CSS file. However, recently I found out that using the <code>max-width</code> property, I could compress this code quite a bit:</p><pre>#inner {
  max-width: 700px;
  margin: auto;
}</pre><p>This does effectively the same thing. Using this formula not only compresses the code, but if I were to change the max width, I would have to change only one property, as opposed to the previous method.</p><p>I wonder...how much time would I have saved to have known that in the first place?</p></div></div>
